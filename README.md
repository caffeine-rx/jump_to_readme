# Jump to README

### Problem

GitHub has many awesome keyboard shortcuts (just press ?), and every
repository has a README file (with very few exceptions). If the number 
of items in the root of the project is large enough, the README is 
pushed pretty far down the page. However, there is no GitHub shortcut 
for jumping to the README section.

### Solution

As a remedy, I created a UserScript (for Firefox or Chrome) to Jump 
to the README section of a github repository.

## To Install

Download the `jump_readme.user.js` file, drag it into your Firefox or 
Chrome window, and confirm when it asks whether you would like to 
install the script. 

## To Use

Hit Ctrl+D to jump to the readme section of the page.


## To Do List
- Add key customization (without manually editing the script)
